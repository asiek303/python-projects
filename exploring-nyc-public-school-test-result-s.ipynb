The SAT consists of three sections:\n","\n","* Reading\n","* Math\n","* Writing\n","\n","Each section is scored out of 800 points, making the total maximum score 2400 (pre-2016 scale). The SAT plays a critical role in college admissions, influencing opportunities for students across the country.\n","\n","## Purpose of the Analysis\n","\n","This analysis focuses on SAT performance within New York City public high schools. Understanding how students perform across different schools has significant implications for:\n","\n","* Education policymakers and government agencies;\n","\n","* School administrators and researchers;\n","\n","* Parents and guardians evaluating school quality;\n","\n","* Equity advocates monitoring disparities in educational outcomes.\n","\n","\n","You have been provided with a dataset named schools.csv, which contains performance data for NYC public schools.\n","\n","This case study explores SAT test scores across New York Cityâ€™s public high schools using real-world education data. The main objective is to apply data manipulation and summary statistics to uncover patterns, compare performance across schools and boroughs and identify potential disparities. By analyzing reading, math and writing scores, this study aims to provide insights valuable to educators, policymakers, and families.\n","\n","You have been tasked with analyzing SAT performance across New York City (NYC) public high schools by answering the following three key questions:\n","\n","1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n","2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n","3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n","\n","\n","# Analysis\n","\n","1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n","\n","The best math results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800 for math."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"cae5c584","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-04T16:04:14.670081Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-04T16:04:14.66928Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.459615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.458774Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.794631,"end_time":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.461314","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-09-04T16:04:14.666683","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import pandas package\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"6190c6b9","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.466182Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.465779Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.510863Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.509729Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.049292,"end_time":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.512516","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-09-04T16:04:16.463224","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1458: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater\n","  has_large_values = (abs_vals > 1e6).any()\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1459: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less\n","  has_small_values = ((abs_vals < 10 ** (-self.digits)) & (abs_vals > 0)).any()\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1459: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater\n","  has_small_values = ((abs_vals < 10 ** (-self.digits)) & (abs_vals > 0)).any()\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>school_name</th>\n","      <th>borough</th>\n","      <th>building_code</th>\n","      <th>average_math</th>\n","      <th>average_reading</th>\n","      <th>average_writing</th>\n","      <th>percent_tested</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M022</td>\n","      <td>657</td>\n","      <td>601</td>\n","      <td>601</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Essex Street Academy</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>395</td>\n","      <td>411</td>\n","      <td>387</td>\n","      <td>78.9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Lower Manhattan Arts Academy</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>418</td>\n","      <td>428</td>\n","      <td>415</td>\n","      <td>65.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>613</td>\n","      <td>453</td>\n","      <td>463</td>\n","      <td>95.9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Henry Street School for International Studies</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M056</td>\n","      <td>410</td>\n","      <td>406</td>\n","      <td>381</td>\n","      <td>59.7</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                         school_name    borough building_code  \\\n","0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...
