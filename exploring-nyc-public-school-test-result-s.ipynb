The SAT consists of three sections:\n\n* Reading\n* Math\n* Writing\n\nEach section is scored out of 800 points, making the total maximum score 2400 (pre-2016 scale). The SAT plays a critical role in college admissions, influencing opportunities for students across the country.\n\n## Purpose of the Analysis\n\nThis analysis focuses on SAT performance within New York City public high schools. Understanding how students perform across different schools has significant implications for:\n\n* Education policymakers and government agencies;\n\n* School administrators and researchers;\n\n* Parents and guardians evaluating school quality;\n\n* Equity advocates monitoring disparities in educational outcomes.\n\n\nYou have been provided with a dataset named schools.csv, which contains performance data for NYC public schools.\n\nThis case study explores SAT test scores across New York Cityâ€™s public high schools using real-world education data. The main objective is to apply data manipulation and summary statistics to uncover patterns, compare performance across schools and boroughs and identify potential disparities. By analyzing reading, math and writing scores, this study aims to provide insights valuable to educators, policymakers, and families.\n\nYou have been tasked with analyzing SAT performance across New York City (NYC) public high schools by answering the following three key questions:\n\n1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n\n\n# Analysis\n\n1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n\nThe best math results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800 for math.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import pandas package\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-04T18:22:11.797012Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-04T18:22:11.797484Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.125764Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-04T18:22:11.797454Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.125031Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv('../input/nyc-public-school/schools.csv')\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.126992Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.127482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.190251Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.127459Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-04T18:22:12.18938Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1458: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater\n  has_large_values = (abs_vals > 1e6).any()\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1459: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less\n  has_small_values = ((abs_vals < 10 ** (-self.digits)) & (abs_vals > 0)).any()\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py:1459: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater\n  has_small_values = ((abs_vals < 10 ** (-self.digits)) & (abs_vals > 0)).any()\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":2,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                         school_name    borough building_code  \\\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...
