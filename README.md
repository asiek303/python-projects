## Python Projects

This is a collection of my first Python scripts and small projects.  
I'm currently learning the language and using this repo to keep track of what I'm working on.

### What's here?

- Simple Python scripts
- Exercises from tutorials and courses
- Small experiments with Python libraries
- Notes and code comments to help me understand what I'm doing

### Why this repo?

This is where I practice, learn version control and slowly improve my coding skills.
